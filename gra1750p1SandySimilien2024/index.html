	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>&frac14; cup sugar</li>
		<li>1 &frac12; tsp baking powder</li>
		<li>&frac14; tsp salt</li>
		<li>&frac12; cup creamy peanut butter (This yields lighter and fluffier pancakes. For thick, dense pancakes you may increase to &frac23; cup)</li>
		<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 egg lightly beaten</li>
		<li>1 cup milk</li>
		<li>&frac12; cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Optional Toppings</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Chocolate syrup</li>
		<li>Whipped cream</li>
		<li>&frac13; cup peanut butter (melted for 12-20 seconds)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>In medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.</li>
		<li>In larger, microwave-safe bowl, microwave peanut butter for 15 seconds. Remove from microwave, stir in vanilla, and then stir in lightly beaten egg, until combined.</li>
		<li>Stir in milk until ingredients are combined (the peanut butter may be clumped and streaky, try to whisk until ingredients are well combined, but some streaks are OK).</li>
		<li>Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and stir once or twice. Add chocolate chips.</li>
		<li>Continue to stir until <strong>just combined</strong> (there may still be a few flour clumps, this is OK but do not overmix the batter)</li>
		<li>Lightly spray a nonstick pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat.</li>
		<li>Once pan is heated, pour about &frac14;-&frac13; cup batter into pan in circle to form pancake. The batter is a bit thick so use a knife or the back of a spoon to nudge some of the batter from the center and into the edges so that the pancake is even and not bulky in the center.</li>
		<li>Cook several minutes, until edges begin to bubble and appear cooked, and then flip and cook the rest of the way through.</li>
		<li>Transfer to plate and serve immediately, preferably topped with chocolate syrup, slightly melted peanut butter, and whipped topping.</li>
	</ol>
